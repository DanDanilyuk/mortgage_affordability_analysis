# Mortgage Affordability Analysis Website

## Overview

This project is a web-based tool designed to help users analyze mortgage affordability based on their financial inputs such as income, expenses, interest rates, and loan terms. It provides estimates for maximum affordable home prices, monthly payments, and amortization schedules to aid in home-buying decisions.

The application is built as a user-friendly website, allowing interactive calculations and visualizations.

## Features

- **Affordability Calculator**: Input your income, down payment, loan term, and interest rate to get instant affordability estimates.
- **Payment Breakdown**: Detailed breakdown of principal, interest, taxes, and insurance (PITI).
- **Amortization Schedule**: Generate and view a full loan amortization table.
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Explore how changes in interest rates or terms affect affordability.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (with potential use of frameworks like React or vanilla JS for interactivity).
- **Backend**: Ruby for data processing and calculations.
- **Libraries**: Chart.js for visualizations, or similar for graphs of payment trends.
- **Data Sources**: Case-Shiller Home Price Index (via FRED API), Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data.
- **Deployment**: Static hosting (e.g., GitHub Pages).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/DanDanilyuk/mortgage_affordability_analysis.git
   cd mortgage_affordability_analysis
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure Ruby is installed (version 3.0 or higher recommended). Install required gems:

   ```
   bundle install
   ```

3. **Set Up API Keys**:
   Obtain API keys from:

   - [FRED API](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/) for Case-Shiller data.
   - [BLS API](https://www.bls.gov/developers/) for economic indicators.
     Set environment variables or pass them directly in commands (see Data Generation).

4. **Run Locally**:
   - Generate the necessary data (see Data Generation).
   - Open `index.html` in a web browser to use the application.

## Data Generation

To generate or update the dataset used for affordability calculations (e.g., Case-Shiller indices and BLS economic data):

1. Ensure you have the required API keys.
2. Run the Ruby script with the following command:
   ```
   ruby weekly_case_shiller.rb --bls-api-key YOUR_BLS_API_KEY --fred-api-key YOUR_FRED_API_KEY
   ```
   - Replace `YOUR_BLS_API_KEY` and `YOUR_FRED_API_KEY` with your actual API keys.
   - This script fetches and processes data, saving it to the appropriate data files used by the application.
3. The generated data will be stored in the project directory (e.g., `/data` folder) for use by the frontend.
4. After running the script, open `index.html` in a web browser to view the application.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Enter your financial details in the input form:
   - Annual income
   - Monthly debts
   - Desired down payment percentage
   - Loan term (years)
   - Estimated interest rate
3. Click "Calculate" to view results, including:
   - Maximum affordable home price
   - Estimated monthly mortgage payment
   - Affordability ratio
4. Use sliders or inputs to adjust variables and see real-time updates.
5. Export or print the results for reference.

Example inputs:

- Income: $80,000/year
- Down Payment: 20%
- Term: 30 years
- Rate: 4.5%
